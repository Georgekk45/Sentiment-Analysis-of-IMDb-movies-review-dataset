# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-movies-review-dataset

The aim of this project is to develop a system that recognizes the user's feelings based on reviews given to a movie. This work requires the training of a sentiment analysis model from reviews given in films. After training, the model's performance is evaluated against a set of metrics such as categorization accuracy, time of training and categorization. Then, an application was implemented that  could accept a review text as input and return the category to which it belongs (positive or negative.)
